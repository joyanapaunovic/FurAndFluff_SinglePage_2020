                Scout and Sam are sisters from other misters. Born from different litters, 
                but came to our rescue weeks apart and have grown up together since they were just a few weeks old. 
                Their bond is just as deep as true sisters are. Sam (the moo kitty) is a cuddle bug and loves to nuzzle in your neck.
                Scout is the class clown and always looking to be the center of attention and life of the party.
                These two play, eat, cuddle and groom each other all the time and Sam looks after her little 
                sister like any big sister does. If you’re looking to fill your home with lots of love,
                these two girls are better than one.

                    If you're just starting your search, 
                    you may be asking yourself what kind of 
                    dog or cat would be best for your lifestyle. 
                    You may be diligently researching the characteristics 
                    of each breed, making a list of which breeds would and 
                    wouldn't be a fit.

                <p>
                    To you, we say: Relax! It's okay to 
                    do your research, but don't feel like breed selection 
                    is the ultimate key to finding your perfect match. 
                    It really is about much more than what looks good on paper:	
                    it's about the individual dog or cat's personality and the 
                    chemistry you feel together (yep, we have chemistry with 
                    animals just like we do with other humans!). And don't 
                    forget about those marvelous mutts! Not only do you get 
                    a one-of-a-kind companion, but many veterinarians say 
                    that mixed-breed dogs tend to be healthier than purebred dogs, 
                    who tend to be prone to certain genetic conditions, 
                    depending on the breed.

                The information below will

            <h4>Adopting from a Rescue</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You find a pet you want to adopt on our 
                        site who's at a rescue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You read that pet’s Adoption Process. 
                        It says fill out their online application, 
                        and there’s a link on that pet’s page to 
                        that rescue’s website and application. 
                        The next day, one of the rescue’s volunteers 
                        calls you and you talk to them more about the pet. 
                        It seems like a good match, and agree to come meet 
                        the pet at their adoption event in a local pet store 
                        that weekend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An event volunteer calls a home check volunteer, 
                        and you all arrange for a home visit. 
                        After the home visit, you get a call 
                        from a volunteer to let you know you will 
                        be the home adopting the pet! They email you 
                        copies of his vaccination and sterilization records. 
                        You arrange a delivery day for your new pet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your new pet is brought by his foster 
                        volunteer to your home! You sign their 
                        adoption contract and pay their adoption fee 
                        (usually ranges from $100 to $300 but sometimes more).
